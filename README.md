## Getting Started

Follow these steps to set up and run the backend.

---

### Prerequisites

- [Java 21](https://adoptium.net/en-GB/) (Ensure `java -version` outputs version 21)
- [IntelliJ IDEA](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/download/) (Community Edition is fine)
- [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/download/)
- [Redis](https://redis.io/docs/latest/operate/oss_and_stack/install/archive/install-redis/)
- [Maven](https://maven.apache.org/download.cgi) (optional, IntelliJ can handle Maven)

---

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/Revive.git
cd Revive/app/server
```

---

### 2. Set Up PostgreSQL

1. **Install PostgreSQL** and start the service.
2. **Create a database and user:**

   ```sql
   CREATE DATABASE nutritrack;
   CREATE USER banana WITH PASSWORD 'bread';
   GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON DATABASE nutritrack TO banana;
   ```

   *(You can change the username and password, but update the config files accordingly.)*

---

### 3. Set Up Redis

1. **Install Redis** and start the server.
2. Follow the instructions on the [official website](https://redis.io/docs/latest/operate/oss_and_stack/install/archive/install-redis/).
3. By default, the server will start on localhost at port 6379.

---

### 4. Configure `application.properties`

Edit `src/main/resources/application.properties` to match your PostgreSQL and Redis setup:

```properties
spring.datasource.url=jdbc:postgresql://localhost:5432/nutritrack
spring.datasource.username= your db username here
spring.datasource.password= your db password here

spring.cache.type=redis
spring.data.redis.host=localhost
spring.data.redis.port=6379
```

---

### 5. Create a `.env` File

At the root of the `app/server` directory, create a `.env` file with your JWT secret and duration:

```env
JWT_SECRET="examplesecret" (put your secret here in quotation marks like this)
JWT_DURATION=3600000 (or whatever you want)
```

---

### 6. Open and Run in IntelliJ IDEA

1. Open IntelliJ IDEA.
2. Select **Open** and choose the `app/server` folder.
3. Let IntelliJ import the Maven project and download dependencies.
4. Click the green arrow to run the backend server

---

### 7. API Usage

- The backend will start on `http://localhost:8080` by default.
- Use Postman or your frontend to interact with the API.

---

## Troubleshooting

- If you get database connection errors, double-check your PostgreSQL credentials and that the database is running.
- If you get errors about missing environment variables, ensure your `.env` file is present and formatted correctly.
- For Lombok issues, make sure the Lombok plugin is enabled in IntelliJ.
